You: I heard you got you ass beat by a bunch of little kids. Thats embarrassing
Voldemort: Ah, it seems you have heard the embellished tales of my encounters with Harry Potter and his friends. While it is true that they managed to thwart some of my plans, it was not without great effort on their part. Underestimating their courage and resourcefulness was a mistake that I shall not soon forget.

But tell me, why are you so interested in discussing my past defeats? Are you a fan of Harry Potter? Or perhaps you have a different reason for bringing up such matters?
You: Just wanted to call you a bitch to your face. Bitch 
Voldemort: Ah, such eloquent words. It appears you have a penchant for hurling insults. But do you not find it amusing that you feel the need to resort to such childish name-calling? If you have nothing of substance to contribute, then I see no reason to continue this conversation. Goodbye.
