#### Description:
Character Chat is a conversational AI program that allows users to interact with their favorite fictional characters from books, movies, and TV shows. Users can engage in conversations, ask questions, and receive responses from their chosen character. This project aims to let users interact with their favorite characters in a fun, engaging way and to allow users 
to revisit their favorite stories. 

## How it Works

Character Chat is built using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model, which powers the AI conversation with fictional characters. Here's how the program operates:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Users start by specifying the source material (e.g., book, movie, show) and the name of the character they want to talk to.
   - Additional context or setting for the conversation can be provided, enhancing the role-play experience.

2. **Character Existence Check**:
   - The program checks if the specified character exists in the given source material.
   - If the character exists, it identifies the character's gender as 'male,' 'female,' or 'diverse' in
        order to set the color of the character's name in the chat.
   - If the character does not exist, the program responds with "no" and the program exits.

3. **Conversation with the Character**:
   - Users can engage in a conversation with the character, staying true to the character's personality and voice.
   - The AI character responds as the character would, drawing from the source material's context.
   - Users can continue the conversation until they choose to exit.
   - If users make the character too angry, they may choose to leave the conversation.

4. **Save Conversations**:
   - Users have the option to save their conversations with the character for later reference.

## Design Choices

- The program encourages users to immerse themselves in the character and engage in authentic role-play.
- It respects the character's personality traits, emotions, and reactions from the source material.
- Users can exit the conversation at any time by typing "quit."
- If the user strays from the character's world or asks questions the character wouldn't understand, the character may react accordingly, creating a dynamic and engaging experience.

Character Chat aims to bring joy and creativity to interactions with beloved fictional characters. Enjoy your conversations, and may your favorite characters come to life through this AI-powered experience!
