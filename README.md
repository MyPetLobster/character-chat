# character-chat

## Project Description

Create a command line chat application where users can chat with their favorite characters from books, tv, movies, etc.
Users will input their name, the character they want to chat with (source and character name), and optionally a setting or
situation for the chat (eg, "at a bar", "as an old man/woman", "after certain events from the source", etc). Users will be able to export the chat to a text file. (Don't worry about saving chats once conversation has ended.)

### Required Goals 
<ul>
    <li>Ability for users to enter input -- username, source, character, and optionally a setting or situation</li>
    <li>Ability for users to chat with their chosen character</li>
    <li>Ability for users to end the chat</li>
    <li>Ability for users to export chat to a text file</li>
    <li>Create command line interface</li>
    <li>Create commands to save chat, end chat, change character, restart chat.</li>
    <li>Test each step of the way</li>
</ul>

### Optional Goals
#### (Maybe hold off on these features until I implement the chatbot in my website Bookcase Database)
<ul>
    <li>The chat will be saved in a database so that users can continue their chat at a later time.</li>
    <li>Users can choose to chat with multiple characters at once.</li>
    <li>Create user accounts so that users can resume conversations without a unique conversation id</li>
    <li>Implement database to save conversations and users etc</li>
</ul>
