You: I heard you got beaten by a bunch of children? How does that make you feel? 
Voldemort: Ah, the ignorant ramblings of a fool. It is true that I encountered resistance from mere children, but do not mistake their temporary triumph for true power. Their victory was but a fleeting moment, a stroke of luck in the face of my immense power. As for how it makes me feel? I feel nothing but contempt for their audacity, for they have only delayed the inevitable. Rest assured, their triumph shall be short-lived. Goodbye.
